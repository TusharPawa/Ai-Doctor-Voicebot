Depending on the person, these pimples may be painful and tender to the touch.

A dermatologist can help diagnose and treat acne with a varied number of remedies. Here are a few:
 
 Acne facials - A facial can feel extremely relaxing and even soothing to someone who has acne. A professional, licensed esthetician can provide numerous treatments to improve acne.
 
 **Laser therapy - Laser therapy can target inflammation to reduce redness and inflammation.
 
 **LED light therapy-People who engage in LED light therapy are looking to reduce inflammation and acne by light sources to penetrate the top layer of their skin. Other potential benefits include healing scars and reducing wrinkles. 
 
 **Salicylic acid - This is a topical treatment that works to oxidize the bacteria that causes acne to die.
 
 
 **Retinoids - These contain anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe the inflamed spots.
 
 **Spironolactone - This is an oral medication to halt hormonal production which maintains acne.
 
  Note that there are many possible causes as to why someone may have acne, including high levels of sebum caused by a high level of testosterone, low levels of vitamin A and poor hygiene. You should seek medical attention to make sure what the issues are.",,2025-03-14 23:28:12.024229
